            Welcome to a programming environment where you will be learning how to code with BlocklyDuino. 
            <br>
            <br>You will be programming with the goal of connecting a joystick and a LED light that is on your arduino to a game that has been created for you. 
            <br>
            <br>To set up your arduino correctly so that it can be used for programming, please ask your teacher. 
            
            <br>For the teacher, read the README file for instructions on how to set up the arduino. 
            
            <br>First find the instructions on the left side of the page. Here is explained what you will have to do in order to program the joystick and the LED. In the middle of the page you can find "GoogleBlockly". This is the application where you will work with blocks in order to program. Whenever you get stuck on what a block can do, you can look in tips for some explanation of useful blocks. On the right you can find a link to the game. Whenever you would like to try your code in the game, first press 'upload code' and then start up the game. 
            <br>
            <br>Good luck! 
            
            <br>Kind regards, 
            
            <br>Nika, Abhinav, Thomas, Tomas, Roisin
